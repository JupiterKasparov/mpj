Jupiter's Lightweight Music Player

This music player I've made is a really lightweight, but complex program. While it's quite easy to use, it uses a pretty complex, fully custom user interface, to have an ancient, DOS-style look and feel.

Written 100% in Free Pascal, this project requires at least Lazarus 1.6.4 (FPC 3.0.2) to successfully compile. Windows-only. Uses quite a few WinAPI calls, to bypass some Lazarus LCL restrictions and adverse effects imposed by Windows itself, and uses Squall.dll to play the music.
